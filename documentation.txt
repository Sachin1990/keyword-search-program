Understanding of the problem statement:-
--------------------------------------
1) Index Mode :-
Input :- Url of website
example:- www.helpinglostpets.com, www.jobsite.co.uk
The program should take url as an input, crawl through the contents of the site and list the keywords excluding the adjectives and conjunctions.
The keywords should be listed based on weightage. The weights for the keyword should be given based on the number of occurences of the word in site.
The extracted keywords should be stored in a file

2) Search Mode :-
Input :- search keyword
example :- dog,cat
The program should take a search keyword as input and list the websites containing more occurences of the keyword in descending order.

=============================================================================================================================================================

Steps to run the program:-
-------------------------
1) Goto the directory named containing the code in the command prompt.
2) Type the command "php KeywordSearch.php".
3) The program prompts to enter the url to be crawled.Enter the url
4) Program lists the keywords along with its weight.
5) Then the program ask to select option of index or search mode.
6) If search mode is chosen then the program asks to enter keyword.
7) If keyword matchs, then websites containing the keyword is listed in descending order of their weights.

Explaination of the code :-
------------------------
1) Navigation :- Navigation function is used to navigate between index and search mode. When a user enters the url it records the url in a file.
   ----------

2) Index Mode :-
   -----------
*) Get the page text :- get_web_page( ) function fetchs the contents the of the web pageusing CURL.
*) Determine the page's character encoding :- The content type of the webpage is parsed to get the character encoding.
*) Convert the page text to UTF-8 :- It is not practical to code for a keyword extractor for different character encoding.Hence mb_convert_encoding()
   is used to convert the contents into UTF-8 encoding.
*) Remove HTML syntax :-  strip_html_tags( ) function is used to strip HTML tags.
*) Decode HTML character references :- html_entity_decode() function is used to decode HTML character references like &copy; creates a © symbol etc.
*) Strip punctuation characters :- strip_punctuation() function is used to remove unwanted characters like punctuations, full stops etc.
*) Strip symbol characters :- strip_symbols( ) function is used to remove symbols like =,+,- etc.
*) Strip number characters :- strip_numbers() function is used to remove numbers from the content.
*) Convert to lower case :- mb_strtolower() function is used to lower case the words in the contents.
*) Split the text into a word list :- mb_split() function is used split the text into words.
*) Stem the words :- Stemming shortens a word to its root. This reduces words like "Stem", "Stems", and "Stemming" to just "Stem".This is achieved using 
   PHP implementation of "The Porter Stemming Algorithm".
*) Remove stop words :- The stopwords like and, is, the etc is removed by creaating a library of stop words and comparing the stopwords with the words 
   extracted from the web page and removing them.
*) Count keyword usage :- The number of occurences of the keywords is counted and sorted in descending order.The ocurrences is considered as the strength
   of the keyword.
*) Write the keywords to a file :- Finally the extracted keywords and their strengths are recored in file under the name of the website which the user
   had entered.

3) Search Mode:- The entered search key is searched against the list of keywords extracted from the websites, which are stored in a file. If two or
   ------------  more website contain the same key then the websites are listed in descending order based on their keyword strength.
